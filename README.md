> JavaScript libp2p record object follows specification([IPRS](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/blob/master/records/README.md)) implementation

# Description

# Usage

## Example record

```
// Record is a IPLD object
{
  '@context': {
    mlink: 'http://merkle-link'
  },
  scheme: {
    mlink: <hash to validity scheme or identifier for hard coded validity scheme>
  },
  expires: <data>, // datetime at which record expires
  value: <data>, // the data that this Record Stores
}
```


# Record types

A record type should be identified by its validity scheme and a record validity scheme should be a MerkleDAG object containing its validity checking rules, however, for simplicity, we have developed 4 types of records, in which their validity schemes are hardcoded in this module. To identify which validity scheme to use, we use a enum:

- a - signed, valid within a datetime range
- b - signed, expiring after a Time-To-Live
- c - signed, based on ancestry (chain)
- d - signed, with cryptographic freshness
